# Lambdas

A lambda can only be one line  
runs a single expression that is automatically returned  

## Built in functions

### map

A standard function that takes at least two args
* A function
* an iterable (sth that can be iterated )

Runs the labda for each value and returns a map object that can be converted to another data structure  

### filter

There is a lambda for each value in the iterable  
returns a filter object thatcan be turned into other iterables  
The object only contains values that return true to the lambdas
